# Style3D Block

> [!WARNING]
**This project is in development.** The API is unstable, features may be added or removed, and breaking changes are likely to occur frequently and without notice as the design is refined.

Block is a high-performance algorithm library implemented on [NVIDIA Warp](https://github.com/NVIDIA/warp).
It is designed for real-time physics simulation and provides foundational components for collision detection and linear system solving.

- Built on NVIDIA Warp for GPU-native performance  
- Targeted at real-time physics pipelines (collision detection, constraint/solver stages)  
- Core components: basic collision detection and linear system solvers
